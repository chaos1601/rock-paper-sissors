## Rock, Paper, Scissors
I am sure everyone has at least heard of this game, but did you know that you can play this game against a computer just by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? 
In this tutorial, I will show you how it is done.

### Steps
You first need to set up your HTML, CSS and JavaScript correctly which you should have enough knowleage to do so without me needing to explain. 
Same goes for connecting CSS and JavaScript to HTML. 

Some things you will need would be, a ```<div>``` with a class named "container", and within that ```<div>```, you have another ```<div>``` with a class
to make sure the game is in the center of the screen as shown below.
``` HTML
<div class="container">
  <div class="game">
    <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
    <p>Choose your move:</p>
    <button class="rock">Rock</button>
    <button class="paper">Paper</button>
    <button class="scissors">Scissors</button>
    <p class="result"></p>
    </div>
</div>
```
